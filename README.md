# Sleeping Sounds

Sleeping Sounds is a project thinking through the Flutter Course (https://www.appbrewery.co/) as a challenge for the Xylophone app.

The app contais 7 different sounds to listen to when you want to sleep. They are:

1 - Light Storm;

2 - Bamboo Wind;

3 - Cave Dripping Water;

4 - Fireplace;

5 - Rainfores;

6 - Strong Storm;

7 - River.

When you play a sound, it plays in looping.
When you play another sound, the last one stops playing.
If you want, you can stop the sound pressing stop button.
